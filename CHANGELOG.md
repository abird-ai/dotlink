# Changelog

All notable changes to dotlink are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added

- Embedded single-owner OAuth 2.1 authorization/resource server for Streamable HTTP, including Protected Resource Metadata, Authorization Server Metadata, authorization code + mandatory PKCE S256, exact resource binding, RFC 9207 `iss`, CIMD, DCR fallback, revocation, rotating refresh tokens, and short-lived opaque access tokens.
- Stable `--ngrok-domain`, explicit reverse-proxy `--public-url`, local `--oauth/--no-oauth`, and the one-run `--allow-public-no-auth` escape hatch.
- `dotlink oauth status/clients/revoke/revoke-all` for inspecting and revoking persisted remote OAuth clients and refresh grants.
- OAuth owner credentials stored as Argon2id hashes, approved DCR clients and hashed refresh grants stored under the private Abird XDG state namespace, while authorization codes/access tokens remain memory-only.
- Cross-process locking around OAuth state read/modify/write so setup, management commands, and a live server cannot lose one another's changes.
- Task-oriented, colorized CLI help with sections for setup/profiles, transports, remote HTTP/OAuth, filesystem access, shell/network, and diagnostics; profile/OAuth subcommand help now documents argument meanings and examples.
- Automatic forward migration for known-compatible profile schemas. Schema v9 now migrates to v10 in memory because the v10 fields are additive/defaulted; migrated profiles are written as v10 on their next edit/save.

### Changed

- Public ngrok ingress is OAuth-protected by default, independently of local HTTP OAuth.
- Direct non-loopback HTTP is also safe-by-default: it requires OAuth plus an explicit HTTPS public origin, unless `--allow-public-no-auth` is supplied for that run.
- Refresh tokens are issued only when the approved client advertises the `refresh_token` grant; `offline_access` requires that capability.
- Installers now resolve the latest GitHub Release by default and act as idempotent updaters when re-run.
- The version command and GitHub Release title now use the concise `dotlink v0.6.0` form; installer and CI version checks accept the new CLI format while still recognizing older installed binaries.
- README positioning now emphasizes invoking `@dotlink` directly from ChatGPT chats/Spaces/dots and connecting several machines without installing the ChatGPT desktop app or provisioning SSH.
- Profile and OAuth CLI documentation has been updated to match the live command surface, including the persisted `oauth` setting.
- Setup now describes launch-directory access accurately: the default `.` permission follows whichever directory dotlink is started from, while the current directory is shown only as context.
- Compatible config migrations are explicit and versioned rather than globally rejecting every older schema; newer schemas and older schemas without a defined migration path are still rejected rather than guessed.

### Fixed

- Filesystem deny checks now apply to both lexical and canonical paths so a denied namespace cannot be reintroduced through a later symlink alias.
- Filesystem mutators and shell execution are serialized against reads through the LocalMachine operation gate, closing dotlink-originated path-topology TOCTOU races.
- Existing write/edit targets must be regular files; special files such as sockets/FIFOs/devices are rejected.
- Runtime-key writes are atomic, credentials stay in dotlink's owned XDG directory even with `DOTLINK_CONFIG`, and active config/credential paths are protected from MCP/sandbox self-modification.
- Shell timeout uses one absolute deadline across stdin, process execution, and output collection, and timed-out/failed children are explicitly reaped.
- Runtime flags mixed with profile subcommands are rejected rather than silently ignored.
- Mixed stdio/OpenAI human status remains off stdout, and manual stdio Ctrl+C handling is symmetric across Unix/Windows.
- Installers validate the downloaded binary's reported version before replacement and use same-directory replacement paths for updates.

### Security

- Argon2 verification runs in bounded blocking workers rather than Tokio workers, with bounded concurrency and failed-attempt delay but no remotely triggerable global owner lockout.
- CIMD validation uses HTTPS-only metadata URLs, redirect refusal, public-IP/DNS checks, pinned vetted addresses, bounded bodies, and exact client-ID matching.
- Unauthenticated DCR registrations remain bounded and memory-only until owner approval.
- Public OAuth state is bounded, durable refresh-token material is stored only as hashes, and owner password plaintext is never persisted.
- Public ingress never derives OAuth issuer/resource identity from Host/Forwarded headers.
- Public no-auth remains an explicit one-run-only escape hatch and is not persisted.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- Modular OpenAI Tunnel, stdio, Streamable HTTP, and optional ngrok MCP transports around one shared LocalMachine policy.
- Pi-style MCP tool surface: `ls`, `read`, `write`, `edit`, platform shell, plus separate binary read/write/patch tools.
- Named JSONC profiles with persisted transport, filesystem allow/deny, shell/network, and developer-cache configuration.
- Linux Bubblewrap shell sandbox with network disabled by default, NixOS runtime/profile support, Nix-daemon masking, and explicit developer-cache mounts.
- Interactive setup, profile management commands, live `Ctrl+R` restart and `v` verbosity cycling, quiet-by-default TOOL/REQ logging, and policy-aware `--list-tools`.
- Automatic full-runtime OpenAI Tunnel recovery after repeated transient poll failures.
- Crane-based Nix builds, static Linux x86_64/ARM64 releases, Windows x86_64/ARM64 cross builds, macOS ARM64 cross build, release aggregation, and curl/PowerShell installers.
- GitHub tag-to-release automation with individual binaries and SHA-256 sidecars.

### Changed

- Rebranded the project to **abird dotlink** with `dotlink` as the crate, executable, MCP identity, config namespace, and release prefix.
- Moved dotlink-owned XDG state under `abird/dotlink`.
- Made profile-enabled transports start automatically; runtime `--stdio/--http` add transports and `--no-*` flags suppress persisted defaults.
- Made the launch directory the relative-path base and default read-only grant; all additional authority is expressed through additive allow/deny rules.
- Made `--allow-rw=/` the natural unrestricted filesystem grant while keeping Linux shell sandboxing independent.
- Consolidated unsandboxed full-host authority into the paired `--allow-all --no-sandbox` flags.
- Made developer caches shell-only capabilities that never expand MCP filesystem access.
- Made stdio stdout protocol-only and routed human/log output to stderr.

### Fixed

- Restored exact terminal state on clean exit, restart, transport errors, and unwind paths.
- Fixed NixOS shell executable/PATH resolution and runtime mount behavior without exposing the whole home directory.
- Hardened Nix-daemon masking against varying filesystem shapes.
- Hardened Runtime API key storage and protected control-plane paths.
- Made setup transactional and re-setup preserve existing secrets by default.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- Scoped the filesystem workspace to the process launch directory by default.
- Added ChatGPT tunnel-registration instructions.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- Initial native Rust Secure MCP Tunnel client.
- Embedded rmcp server with local filesystem and Bash tools.
